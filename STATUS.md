6. Add shopping list generation based on meal ingredients

## Known Issues/Blockers
1. CoreGraphics NaN errors in view layouts causing potential UI issues
2. Firebase AppCheck configuration failing on current platform
3. Firestore permission issues preventing access to 'families' collection
4. Event editing and deletion needs to be implemented
5. Meal editing and deletion needs to be implemented
6. Google Calendar integration needs to be tested
7. Shopping list generation feature pending

## Recent Updates

- Improved view model initialization in calendar views
- Fixed actor isolation issues in DayViewModel
- Updated Firebase paths to use family-centric structure
- Implemented proper meal assignment handling
- Removed redundant view model initializations
- Added proper MainActor annotations for UI updates
- Identified critical CoreGraphics NaN errors in view layouts
- Discovered Firebase AppCheck and permission issues

## Repository Setup
- [x] GitHub repository created
- [x] README.md with setup instructions
- [x] .gitignore configured for sensitive files
- [x] LICENSE (MIT) added
- [x] Initial codebase pushed

# Current Status

## Working Features
- User authentication with Google Sign-In
- Family member creation and storage in Firestore
- Family member data persistence and retrieval
- Meal creation interface
- Basic UI for meal assignment

## Known Issues
1. Meal assignment not working due to Firebase App Check configuration
2. Meals are not being saved to Firestore properly

## Recent Changes
1. Updated Firestore security rules to properly handle nested collections
2. Added explicit App Check debug mode configuration in `FamilyCalendarApp.swift`
3. Configured proper collection paths for meal storage under `users/{userId}/meals`

## Current Implementation
- Using nested Firestore collections under user documents:
  - `users/{userId}/familyMembers`
  - `users/{userId}/meals`
  - `users/{userId}/mealPlans`
- Firebase App Check is configured for debug mode
- Firestore security rules are set up for proper access control

# Project Status

## Recent Changes
- Restructured data model to be family-centric
- Created proper view models with MainActor isolation for thread safety
- Fixed Firebase AppCheck configuration for debug mode
- Separated shared views (EventView, MealView) into their own files
- Updated MealView to properly handle meal template loading
- Fixed family member creation to include required fields (familyId, role)

## Current Issues
1. MealView needs to properly load and display meal templates
2. Some view model actor isolation issues have been fixed but may need further testing
3. Firebase AppCheck configuration has been updated but needs testing

## Working Features
- Family management (creation, member addition)
- Basic authentication
- Day schedule view structure
- Event display

## In Progress
- Meal template integration with assignments
- Family member management improvements
- Schedule view refinements
