## Today's Progress (March 19, 2024)

### Completed Setup
1. ✅ Created Xcode project and organized file structure
2. ✅ Added Firebase SDK using Swift Package Manager
3. ✅ Set up Firebase project and downloaded configuration
4. ✅ Created Google Cloud project and configured OAuth
5. ✅ Set up GitHub repository with:
   - Proper .gitignore for sensitive files
   - MIT LICENSE
   - Comprehensive README
   - Templates for configuration files
6. ✅ Organized project structure with Models, Views, and ViewModels

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Initial App Testing
Once simulator download completes:
- Launch app in simulator
- Check Xcode console for Firebase initialization messages
- Verify AuthenticationView appears correctly
- Look for any immediate build errors or warnings

### 2. Authentication Testing
Test the following flows:
1. Email/Password Registration:
   - Open app to AuthenticationView
   - Navigate to registration
   - Test form validation
   - Create test account
   - Verify Firebase Auth creation

2. Email/Password Login:
   - Test with created account
   - Verify error messages
   - Check login state persistence

3. Google Sign-In:
   - Test OAuth flow
   - Verify permissions request
   - Check Google Calendar access

### 3. Calendar Integration
After authentication is working:
1. Test Google Calendar API:
   - Verify API access
   - Test calendar listing
   - Check event fetching

2. Implement Core Calendar Features:
   - Event creation
   - Event viewing
   - Basic synchronization

### 4. Data Model Testing
Verify all models work with Firebase:
1. Event Model:
   - Create test events
   - Verify Firestore storage
   - Test real-time updates

2. Meal Model:
   - Create test meals
   - Link to calendar events
   - Test meal planning features

3. FamilyMember Model:
   - Create family members
   - Test permissions
   - Verify member management

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. Local Calendar Management:
   - Implement offline support
   - Add local caching
   - Sync queue for offline changes

2. Meal Planning:
   - Enhanced meal creation
   - Recipe integration
   - Shopping list generation

### Phase 3 Planning
1. Real-time Features:
   - Family member location sharing
   - Event notifications
   - Calendar sharing improvements

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Approach
1. Start with unit tests for models
2. Add UI tests for critical flows
3. Test on multiple iOS versions
4. Verify iPad layout

### Code Quality
1. Run SwiftLint regularly
2. Follow SwiftUI best practices
3. Document all major components
4. Keep STATUS.md updated

### Security Considerations
1. Never commit sensitive files:
   - GoogleService-Info.plist
   - Info.plist with credentials
2. Regular security review of:
   - Authentication flows
   - Data access rules
   - API usage
